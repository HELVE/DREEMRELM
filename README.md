# /// DREEMRELM2.0  

## Introduction to the new version
[VER 2.0 INCOMING] Perpetual Trance Environment

## Ideas
- make a recognizable visual communication for the project - imagine a near future where people go to the Dreemrelm to sooth their pain of existence and figure out internally their direction in life. Productivity and self-discovery hypnosis.
- new base set up environment (i remember thinking of a circular experience surround the audience and perhaps even slowly rotating around?)
- write down the poem
- restructure the poem
- for each word said in the beginning phase make a microworld/scene that relates to that specific state or emotion (aspirations)
- Write a script. 
- Research 3D photography layering on moving film. 
- Shoot urban and natural landscapes. 
- Setup crowdsourcing. Think what could be done to Dreemrelm to make it better
- write down the elements.
- audio interviews from people about aspiration.
- repurpose 'I'm a flickering moth' video.
- write down the purpose of the film.
- research the possibility of neural effects (audience emotionally repurposing the video).

###  To Do

### Notes

The purpose of the film: mesmerize, analyze the notion of aspirations and show various implications of thinking about it in different ways, show life as it is in my mind.

Elements:

Intro.
Crowds and protests.
Treeform.
Daydream.
Nightdream.
'I believe people want to be true. Not just true to other people but to themselves. There is no substitute to knowing one's worth'.

'What visually constitutes aspirations/dreams?

-That's not even the question I want to ask. It is in fact completely unrelated.- Aspirations are thoughts of a distant intent. The visual has nothing to do with the representation of a thought. The thought-image is too abstract to be depicted. It is a fleeting stance and directioning of the mind and so an aspiration is a fleeting and vague directioning of a distant intent. Hence an aspiration is an abstract notion in itself: it shifts, transforms and morphs into "something else", a feeling of so brief period we cannot comprehend the actual direction our mind is taking. We go with it in a complete benevolence, reciting the intents that are long passed and gone. Floating in spacial endlessness we recite the worlds of our own creation.'

Crowd and protests

clips of protesters from Archive.org (?) - Occupy Movement.

'What drives those people? We are so good as a whole. So so good, and yet we want to distance ourselves from others, make them believe we are protected and strong, but are we really?

Look at those people locking themselves into apartments with bars and secret codes. Living behind a fortified fence of a community of separate entities. Leading their plain lives not pursuing their calling, afraid to step up to the task.

We rampage about human right to freedom of speech but the vast majority prefers to be inside somewhere, locked away. Electronic means of communication is all that remains as we move within the boundaries, around the existing structure.

Treeform

Imagery of tree branches. Starting from a massive trunk as we are taught how to live our lives, transforming into thinner and thinner paths as we venture out into unknown fields. Every end of the branch spawns a visual POINT, which is the point of breaking the barrier and breaking free into the beyond - your own way of understanding things. Back away and you see endlessness of the tree structure (multiplicities of tree structures - possibilities). It all leads into unknown at the breaking point. Don't be afraid to reach the end of the structure.

'Every path you take leads you somewhere. Don't be afraid to take a wild step. The bigger picture is omitted once your break out of the patterns and expand your flight (line of flight). There is no predetermined bigger picture once you are out there in the white. You are free to discover and make the most of what you've got in yourself.

Daydream

Aerial and urban landscapes of Warsaw in the morning. Slow motion street, every day life, mundane activities. Space of the living. Nation in sleep.

'Our reasoning has been dimmed in the light of -greed- fear. You shop, you walk, you go about the business of your day. You help others, you talk with them, exchange ideas, you love things and you hate things, you live, you eat, you party, (?) you are walking through a tunnel.

You stand in the shop queues, you enjoy the big and the small things in life, you smile, you grin'. Standing in lines your whole life, moved into position years ago you cannot plunge ahead and obliterate the structure.

-scene set in a window of a tenement block. Camera from the outside -> family /yellow light/ having a meal -> violence occurs. choppy picture.

Nightdream

Sitting on a rooftop, laying your future in front of you against the darkened sky. Subconscious plans and treaties swirling in. Eyes closed yet most open to possibility of happiness.

'I always felt the most alive, the most calm, after a night full of deep dreams - it used to be my only escape into the white. The most important thing an artist can learn is that experiencing the subconscious while asleep is the easy way out. It doesn't bring you any viable results. It's just a gif of a holo-flower destined to bloom but only in the virtual space. You won't smell it, you won't be able to touch it and above all you won't be able to mould it and change its variables to what your heart tells you. Now, wake up and experience the subconscious in broad daylight."

Remodernist narrative based on a theory of rhizome.

William Burroughs of cinematography - script as a cut out / just singular words of feeling and dialog.

It all became frantic, savage - as soon as the spread of information became more important than the content itself - forces working until that point, withdrew the plugs.
